# Roll20 OnePager script

Generates an HTML page containing a Bookmarklet to bring the content of an entire Roll20 forum topic into the first page for easy text searching.

To just access a precomiled version of the bookmarklet, go here: [Precompiled bookmarklet](dist/onepager.html)

Otherwise, to build it yourself, clone this repository and run:

```
npm install
npm compile
```

And an HTML document should be produced in the `dist/` directory.
