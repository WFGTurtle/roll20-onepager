# Roll20 OnePager Bookmarklet

{% include_relative dist/onepager.html %}

---

To build the bookmarklet yourself, head over to the repository at [github.com/WFGTurtle/roll20-onepager](https://github.com/WFGTurtle/roll20-onepager), clone it, and run:

```
npm install
npm compile
```

And an HTML document should be produced in the `dist/` directory.
